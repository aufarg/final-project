% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite

%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or

% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

ARINC 653 is a software specification which primary purpose is to provide isolation or
partitioning of application domains. The specified partitioning scheme in ARINC 653 will prevent
one domain affecting other domains. This could be achieved by making sure each domain have
their own portion of shared resource, including, but not limited to CPU time, memory, and
I/O bandwidth.

Isolation and partitioning is important in aviation, as it allows multiple application each with
their own possibly different level of certification to be run in different partitions on the
same platform. An example of such platform is Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) systems. These
systems were created to supersede federated systems, which maintain application isolations by
having separated platform for each application. ARINC 653 was created to standardized operating
systems for these platforms.

ARINC 653 protect each application from the fault that is experienced by other applications in
different partition. Despite of being protected of fault from other domains, any fault the
application experienced from it's own partition will still happen. It might be the case that
the faulty application or partition is a safety-critical system or part of such system. Failure
of such application or partition leads to significant increase of the safety risk for the
people and/or partition involved. This leads to the need of system reliability in the platform
or operating system to reduce the safety risk in case of failure.

There are several ways to achieve system reliability in ARINC 653 operating systems. One way is
to make sure the application and its partition would continue to operate even when it has
failed. This could be done by having domains that have the same applications and partition to
replace the faulty domain. These domains are called backup domains and the replaced domain is
called the primary domain. In normal situations, the backup domains will not be given any CPU
time and will reside in background. Once the hypervisor detect that the primary domain
experienced a fault, one of the backup domains will its replace place to provide service that is
compatible with the required services. The described scheduling algorithm is called
primary-backup scheduling.

The primary-backup scheduling algorithm is implemented on ARINC 653 compliant hypervisor called
ARLX. The ARLX hypervisor is an ARINC 653 compliant extension to the open-source Xen hypervisor
and is developed, by DornerWorks, according to the strict safety assurance directed by DO-178.
It is created to increase the pace of innovation and reduce development of ARINC 653 operating
systems by giving researchers access to working prototype and engineers the freedom of open
source license. Since the ARLX hypervisor already provide ARINC 653 scheduler with ARINC 653
compliant scheduling algorithm, we only need to modify the current ARINC 653 scheduler
scheduling algorithm to support picking between primary and backup domains.

This paper will focused on developing primary-backup scheduling algorithm on ARINC 653 compliant
hypervisor. The main topic of this paper includes describing the primary-backup ARINC 653
scheduling algorithm and analysis of the resulting scheduler in different scenarios.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will cover the current
implementation of ARINC 653 scheduler in ARLX and primary-backup scheduling algorithm. In
Section III we introduce the proposed primary-backup ARINC 653 compliant scheduling algorithm
and provides testing and performance analysis of the proposed scheduling algorithm on different
scenarios.

\section{Some Section}

\subsection{ARINC 653 Scheduler in ARLX}

The primary goal of ARINC 653 specification is to manage contended resources across many domains
with safety and fault isolation for users of these resources. This can be achieved by
partitioning these resources according to resource users' needs. Partition is done on basic
subsystem resources, including, but not limited to, CPU time, memory, and I/O bandwidth. These
partitioning is already implemented on ARLX. In this paper, we will improve the scheduling
algorithm on ARLX to support primary-backup scheme which we will discuss later.

ARINC 653 partition scheduler is a periodically repeating fixed timeslice scheduler for
partitions. The scheduler only concerned with the scheduling of partitions, in this case Xen
domains. Process scheduling for real-time processes inside each partitions are handled by its
process scheduler. In this paper, we interchange the term partition scheduler with scheduler
since we will not cover process scheduler at all.  The scheduler is implemented based on ARINC
653 partition scheduling specification. Every partition to be scheduled has their own fixed
timeslice.  So the partition will be activated at a certain timespan. The partition scheduling
algorithm is predetermined, repetitive with a fixed periodicity.  This period is called the
major time frame.  The major time frame should be big enough to run all the timespan to be
scheduled. Each partition can be configured to take at least one the time-slot within the major
time frame.  Partitions do not have a priority assigned to them so there is no preemption within
the scheduling algorithm except for system calls (hypercalls in hypervisor context) or
interrupts. This has been implemented in ARLX hypervisor.

There are some differences between standard ARINC 653 scheduler and ARLX. Currently in ARLX, the
schedule is configured manually with hypercalls instead of being generated by time-based
activation. It is the engineer responsibility to make determine how much CPU time being
allocated to each partition. Multicore support for partition scheduling is not yet implemented,
so we only deal with uniprocessor architecture.

\subsection{Primary-Backup Scheduling Algorithm}

The problem with faulty partition is that the service it provides will cease to work and/or give
incorrect result. In avionics, this could lead to incorrect calculation of control systems, thus
significantly increase safety-risk for people and/or environment involved. We assume that there
is one-to-one relationship between service and partition. The simplest way to bring back the
service is by restarting the faulty partition. In general cases, there is no way to know whether
restarting faulty partition could bring back said service as the cause of fault could be
persistent.

To improve service reliability, one solution that have been studied many times is by
using primary-backup scheme. Common primary-backup schemes make sure that each partition have
replicas that is identical service-wise to the primary partition before being operational. When
said partition experienced a failure, one of its replicas could take over its place and provide
the same service. While this scheme can seamlessly handle persistent failure on partitions,
identical partitions means the exact same failure in primary are bound to happen in replicas.

For primary-backup scheme on partition scheduler to work indefinitely, replica partitions should
not be identical to their corresponding primary partition. We could think of replicas as
fail-safe mechanism of corresponding primary. This could be achieved by having more mature
application and environments in replicas. We assume that mature version of the application
provide identical service to current version of the application, although it might lack some
non-essential features or optimizations. For applications that do not support backward
compatibility, having flexibility in choosing applications that resides in replicas means we
still have the option to use identical replicas.

\section{Primary-Backup ARINC 653 Scheduler}

In this section, we will look at some of the mechanisms which makes primary-backup scheme on
ARINC 653 scheduler possible. Then we will look at various primary-backup ARINC 653
scheduler usage and analyze <some metrics here>.
% TODO : what metrics %

\subsection{Partition Information}

For the scheduler to know whether a partition should run or not, it needs to know if that
partition is currently okay to run. We will call such information as partition status. The
scheduler also needs information about the service provided in a partition, so the scheduler
does not confuse which primary partition that each backup partition corresponds to. This can be
done by giving service identification and make sure each partition keep its service
identification.  Since we already assume one-to-one relationship between service and partition,
service identification can use partition identification, which already provided by default in
ARLX.

Each partition should keep track of their own status and service identification that it
provides. To let the scheduler know current partition status and service identification, we need
a way to update partition status. This could be done through calling hypercalls from each
partition or intelligent health monitoring. We implement the hypercall method, as it is easy to
implement and offer flexibility for configuration. From base ARINC 653 scheduler on ARLX, we
implement partition information in domain private data. We also implement scheduler hypercalls
on domain-specific context.

\subsection{Scheduling Algorithm}

The scheduler selects one of the runnable partition such that the its status is healthy and
there are no partitions that have provided the service corresponding to its service id.

\subsection{Analysis}

We tested the primary-backup ARINC 653 scheduler on multiple scenarios and measure duration and
failure rate of each partitions.
