% \chapter{Kesimpulan}

% In this paper, we proposed a way to increases the reliability of ARINC 653 operating systems by
% using primary-backup scheme on ARINC 653 partition scheduler. The scheduler works by giving CPU
% time to candidate partition only when it is currently healthy and the corresponding service has
% not provided yet. In order to let the scheduler know partition status, we define a new hypercall
% to modify information associated to a partition. Using primary-backup scheme on ARINC 653
% scheduler increases the reliability for each service and thus prolong the mean time to failure
% for any service. Since we assume that services reliability is the most unreliable component on the
% system, this means the proposed scheduler also increases the whole system reliability.

% While the result of the reliability testing is already good, the testing is done without regards
% of processes' deadline inside of each partition. We intend to do some improvement on the testing
% method so it also considers the deadline of each process inside of each partition. Doing so will
% make the result more relevant to the actual use case of the system. We also plan to have
% another type of test to measure performance difference caused by the overhead of the scheduler
% and analyze the effect of the difference on the system.

% As the paper proposed a new scheduler, there are some issues which need to be solved such as:

% \begin{enumerate}

% 	\item \textit{Space redundancy minimization}: Having backup partitions require extra
% 		space linear to the average redundancy rate of primary partitions for the
% 		system. On the assumption that the mean time to failure for each service to be
% 		reasonably long, we might be able to reduce system required space in overall at
% 		the cost of performance on rare events.

% 	\item \textit{Automatic partition failure detection}: Telling the scheduler whether the
% 		service on a partition is healthy or not can already be done by means of
% 		hypercalls. This cannot be done if the environment on said partition does not
% 		functions properly, which can be caused by transient or inherent problems. The
% 		hypervisor must be able detect such cases automatically so the scheduler could
% 		properly select one of the backup partitions.

% 	\item \textit{Multicore support}: Some of the inherent problems that could happen is
% 		failure of the CPU core which the partition is supposed to run.
% 		Having some other cores could help the scheduler schedule the backup partitions
% 		on different core than the primary to keep the service running.

% 	\item \textit{Automatic schedule list generator}: It is up to the engineer to provide a
% 		schedule list which satisfies the deadline and runtime constraints. Since the
% 		schedule list might need to be adjusted when a partition failure occurs, the
% 		scheduler list should still satisfies the deadline and runtime constraints on
% 		any possible partitions state. This proves to be a daunting task for the
% 		engineer since there will be many cases (up to $2^N$ possible cases, $N$ is the
% 		number of partitions).
